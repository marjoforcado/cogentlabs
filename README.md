# Why I used NextJs

NextJS - is a production ready React framework, it abstracts a lot of the technical decisions I need to make when starting a new project (e.g. Routing, Bundling files)

Tailwindcss - makes it easier for me to provide styles to my components as well as making sure that it is responsive to all devices

Redux Toolkit - State management is essential for creating a serious application. Redux toolkit makes it easy for me to create and retrieve data from the cache
